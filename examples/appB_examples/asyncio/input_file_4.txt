Chairman George Seiler introduced Joyce Walton, teacher of the singing school. He told the class just how lucky the Garden State Convention has been to have such wonderful singing school teachers: Amanda Denson, Ginny Ely, and now Joyce Walton. Joyce spoke about the 1959 recording that Alan Lomax made that has since been released by New World Records, and how so many people have told her that they’ve been touched by her testimony on thatrecording. She said that she wasn’t sure why Mr. Lomax included it, but maybe “he got an inspiration from above that it would give somebody a blessing.” Having heard the class sing, she said, “I can’t teach you how to sing, but I can instill in you a little something [about this music] you might hold onto the rest of your days.” This singing school was about the fine points of leading, and how the leader should get what he or she wants. She stressed the importance of looking people in the eye, and led [436], first at a slow tempo, to demonstrate that the leader should be in charge. She talked about the beauty of the 6-part harmony of Sacred Harp, with men and women doubling the treble and lead parts at the octave. She led the class though the rudiments, stressing the importance of rests: “Running a rest is like running a stop sign.” She then introduced her husband, Jap Walton, and invited him to lead a song. He led [420], which was written by his aunt and uncle in honor of his grandparents. Joyce Walton then led [111b] to demonstrate that when there is a da capo chorus, you should always sing it when you sing the shapes. George Seiler then requested that she lead a fuguing tune to demonstrate the way she brings in the parts, so she led [40]. She demonstrated that every song should have a cut-off. She led [455]and [454], and told the class about Mark Cagle, Bob Denson, and O.A. Parris, from whom she learned much of what she knows about music -- timing, developing a style, and practicing leading in front of a mirror. The final portion of the singing school dealtwith style in leading. She said: “I can make people sing -- I love ‘em into it.”George Seiler thanked Joyce Walton for a wonderful singing school. Ginny Ely spoke of her indebtedness to Joyce Walton as a role model and led [391]. Regular singing resumed with the following leaders: Barbara Benary [168]; Eric Bean [324]; Jean Seiler [299].

H. Creel and Cassie Franklin 381t. The memorial devotional was led by Mary Craig concerning “The Passing Over”. “So he passed over, and all the trumpets sounded for him on the other side.” With these oft’-quoted words, John Bunyan described the passing of Mr. Valiant-for-truth through the River of Death.“I Won’t Have To Cross Jordan Alone”, “Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me”, “There’ll be rest for Me ( On the other side of Jordan)”, the beautiful Navy hymn, “Eternal Father, strong to save, whose arm doth bind the restless wave; O hear us when we cry to Thee for those in peril on the sea.” Death is often described as a voyage--a passing over to “The farther shore.” Poets, the writers of Holy Scripture, and hymn writers convey this idea. Often at funerals we hear quoted Tennyson’s beautiful poem on immortality, (“Crossing the Bar”) “Sunset and Evening Star, And on Clear call for me--And may--there be no moaning at the bar, When I put out to sea.”Yes, we can accept the idea that death is a crossing over. Theodore Roosevelt called it, “The Greatest Adventure”. We are all closer to the “farther shore” than we realize. It is very, very close. Are we making preparations? Do we have our passports? We have our right of passage if we belong to Christ. He is our “Rite” of passage. The sea is charted. There’s a pilot on board. We can stand at the bow unafraid, enjoying, yes, exulting in, this home-going voyage. On the subject of immortality, Jesus is the final authority--the Clarion Voice: Because I live, ye shall live also.....In my Father’s house are many mansions.....I go to prepare a place for you.....I am the resurrection and the life..... Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.....This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise. Those whose lives are honored in this Memorial Moment are as follows: Dale Redmon, 8:30 a.m. Easter Morning, Tatum, Texas; William Lewis Vaughn, May 18, Laneville, Texas; J. P. Hawkins, October 5, 1994; Helen Ivey Cordell and Lois Green from Alabama; Arnevis Norton, June, 1995, San Antonio, Texas; Ethel Clark, March, Huntington; Elder Pete Walker, Conroe, Texas; Lila Fulmer, Smith County, Texas; Y. B. Yancey, Smith County, Texas. Myra Palmer led songs on pages 45t and 403, “How happy are the souls above, from sin and sorrow free, with Jesus they are now at rest, and all His glory see”. The group was dismissed with prayer by David Rousseau.LUNCHThe afternoon session was opened by John Morris leading song on page 335t. Leaders called were: Coy Ivey 63; Joan Aldridge 515; Phyllis Costner 168; Edith Owen 511b; Bob Parr 428; Bill Farris 401; Norma Latham 511t; Everette Denney 283; Carlene Griffin 85; Donald Ross 315; David Rousseau 492; Catherine Rogan 274; Beverly Coates 331b; Aubrey Barfield 140; Leon Ballinger 196; Dale Redmon, Jr. 563; Sandy Hill 334; Tommy Spurlock 574; Cindy Franklin 505; Wanda Capps 571; David Ivey 395; Baron Powers 239; Mickey Thompson 31t; Elizabeth Rogan 215; Ophelia Matthews 384; Dalton Clanton 512; Marie Guthrie 434; Vivian Rogan 32t; Marcelene Hardy 172; Michelle Rogan 427; Monnie Ross 49; Joe Nelson 28b; Gary Rogan 230; Mary Bachmann 346.

A memorial lesson was held by Linda Thomas at this time. She gave us these thoughts to reflect upon, “Part of the host have crossed the flood and part are crossing now. There are many that have crossed before us and we will always miss them. We appreciate the lives they lived and the examples they set for us to follow. We thought we couldn’t sing without them, and no one can take their place, but others join us and we sing on ‘til we meet again where there will be no more parting. I’m glad we are not alone at the crossing. In Luke l6:22 when Lazarus died, he was carried by the angels when his body died. His soul moved out, II Corinthians 5: ‘Absent from the body, present with the Lord.’ We need to lay up treasures in Heaven--invest in things that are eternal because, ‘when we die we leave what we have and take what we are.’ People are the only part of this world that will last forever. The soul never dies, our bodies are temporal, but our new bodies, at the resurrection, will be eternal. The most important thing in life is to be prepared for death. Death is the gate to endless joy.” Jerry Enright led song on page [482] for those who passed away: Fay Allen, Helen Ivey Cordell, Lois Green, Arville Hyatt, Lessie Cates, Forney Cobb, Leon Price, John Morris, Jack Harcrow, Ervin Brothers, Winford Lacey; Dula Webb, Bertha Henson, Orville Boldwin, John Aylor, Dale Redmon, Hoyt Renfroe, Hugh Brandon, Jack Simmons, Lewis Vaughn, Junurs Hudgins, Carlton Hitchcock, Harry Dumas, Velma Kelly, and Ted Godsey.

A business session was convened. Karen Willard gave the Resolutions Committee report as follows. First, we want to thank the Master of the Universe for the opportunity we have been given to come to this place and sing together, and through our singing give glory to God. We all experience deep pleasure and satisfaction in this activity, but through it all we do not lose sight of the primary purpose of our activity -- that is, to render our praise to our Creator. We wish to give thanks to the officers and organizers of this most successful Rocky Mountain Convention; to the hardworking members of the Arranging Committee, and the keyers throughout both days who have kept the songs coming thick and fast and in tune; to the housing arrangers and the most hospitable people of Fort Collins who have opened their homes to us visitors; to the set up and clean up crews who made sure we had chairs to sit in and well-supplied restrooms for this large crowd; to those who arranged the obviously successful publicity; to the Storm Mountain Folk Dancers and the City of Fort Collins, who most kindly allowed the use of the Empire Grange and this room, respectively. There are several who deserve our especial thanks and appreciation: Howard “Golden Throat” Newell for repeating in stentorian tones the song page numbers that all heard clearly; the local inhabitants here who must have a direct connection with whomever is in charge of the weather; the very cheerful and welcoming folks who sacrificed their own singing opportunities to staff the registration table. Their isolation was only increased when the locating committee suddenly discovered a better singing site in the middle of yesterday’s singing; kitchen crew boss, Sun Dance Saloon dinner arranger, and - with husband Don - host of our marvelous Saturday Night party: Sandy Klein. We must not fail to thank, also, the magnificent cooks of Fort Collins. In particular, the excellence of yesterday’s Peanut Butter Parfait pie almost resulted in an offer of matrimony to the anonymous cook-- but we will settle for most satiated and satisfied gratitude. To you lifelong supporters of Sacred Harp, who come to help us newcomers learn what it’s all about by sitting in our square and, by example of arm and voice lead us to achieve heights of glory we’d never reach without you, our humble words of thanks. We hope to someday be able to follow in your footsteps and lend encouragement to the newcomers to come. Our final words of appreciation are reserved for our Singing School instructor, Hugh McGraw. You are perhaps the first and foremost of these conservers and imparters of this tradition. Thanks to you and the other supporters, we too are coming to love and cherish this tradition. We are humbly grateful for your nurturing words of instruction, correction, and guidance. The members of the Resolutions Committee were: Karen Willard, Charlene Wallace, John Ramsey, and Russ Nye. The Finance Committee then reported that the convention expenses had been met by the generous donations of those attending. Finance Committee members were: Deb Robson, Don Klein, and Mary Lou Dick. The Locating Committee announced that next year’s Rocky Mountain Sacred Harp Singing Convention will be the third Sunday and Saturday before in September in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The members of the Locating Committee were: David McPherson, Alice Van Camp, Sandy Hill and Carlene Griffin. A gift of appreciation was presented to Hugh McGraw for all of his support for this convention. The business meeting was then closed. Hugh McGraw, Sandy Hill, and John Ramsey led song on page [62], and invited all who wished to do so, to take the parting hand. Leon Simmons led the class in prayer, and the class was dismissed.Chairman - Sandy Hill; Vice Chairman - John Ramsey."	1995	1	137	0	6	3	9	146	0.0616438356164384

It is a great joy to be with others who feel and express their feelings, and share with others the joys and griefs of their own experiences of Sacred Harp, in their own way, without trying to make others see and believe as they do. May God continue to pour out His Blessings on we poor mortals. May we be blest to continue to share in the glories of Sacred Harp and find the true and lasting fellowship of Sacred Harp in the bounds of eternity, to be with the Lord and His children for ever and ever, Amen.” The morning session concluded with Jean Seiler leading song on [378t] and Marlin Beasley leading a prayer.LUNCHThe afternoon session was called to order by Ginnie Ely leading song on page [389].

Gary Smith said: “Sacred Harp is a song with many voices, with many accents, from many homes. It has many ages, and is ageless. It has become nationwide, and is becoming international. Sacred Harp is and has become an important, vibrant, encompassing part of our lives. In our past, we have traveled, fellowshipped, and, on occasion, endured some measure of hardship for our ‘peculiar’ blessing. We have seen Sacred Harp decline, but now we see it seeming to increase. We have seen examples of singers, living and dead, who have labored mightily to spread Sacred Harp, to root it thoroughly and securely in the only place which really matters, our hearts. Sacred Harp is vitally alive today, as evidenced by the composers whose works we have sung today. To honor those who have gone before, and to honor those who are even now laboring mightily in the Lord’s vineyard, let us now resolve together to continue that work, by singing, and going, and by living in the spirit which gives the Sacred Harp its voice.” Leaders: Guy Bankes [120]; Karen Snowberg [99]; Allen Fannin [45t]; Miriam Kilmer {378}; Kelly House [198]; Gina Balestracci, Virginia Douglas, and Diane Mennella [268].

Southern California Regional Singing	San Pedro, California	May 18, 1996	"The fourth annual Southern California Regional Sacred Harp Singing met on Saturday before the third Sunday in May. The class was called to order by Carla Smith leading song on page [59]. Jim Friedrich offered the opening prayer: Come Holy Spirit, Holy Breath. Fill our hearts with joy and our mouths with praise, that our voices may well up from the deep places, and this room may thunder with the power of abundant life. Tune our songs to the pitch of divinity that we may express to the full the blessing of our humanity to the glory of Your Name, Amen. Rick Russell led song on page [270].

At this time, Susan Turpin presented the memorial: It is now time for our memorial lesson, the time in a Sacred Harp convention when we remember and honor singers, friends, and family who have died in the past year. When we come to this time, we feel grief at our loss. Life is a gift, and this gift has ended for those we have named. Our grief is the grief of love. If we had not loved, we would not now be grieving, and so we can be grateful even for our grief. As we grieve, we realize there is something else about this memorial lesson. My dear friends and companions, it’s the reminder that the journey taken by these friends and loved ones awaits us one day. Death is inevitable. We will all one day face death. And so we wonder, what is this experience of death? What happens when we die? It seems it might be easier if someone would just tell us in plain language, if maybe our scientists could tell us like they tell us about what happens out in space and what goes on inside the cell. But it is not to be. Death seems to be more like the experience of love, more suited to the language of poetry than of science. In these songs we sing, we find rich poetry, with myriad reflections on death. The language is about crossing Jordan’s stream, being on our way to Canaan. I assure you, the writers of the lyrics are not talking about chartering a bus to go see Canaan. No, they’re talking about going home to heaven. And how does this language describe heaven, this glorious home above? As a place where “sickness and sorrow, pain and death are felt and feared no more”; a place where there are “Sweet fields arrayed in living green and rivers of delight.” Just as our Sacred Harp singing is not a place of preaching any dogma, but rather a place to lift our hearts and voices in harmonious music, so this poetry is not meant to be analyzed and evaluated, but rather to be pondered in our hearts. Let the music and words touch your heart and allow your understanding to slowly unfold in what is true for you. And so now as I read the names of those who have gone before us, let us give thanks for all that we have received in the gift of their lives, and in the vision unfolding in each of our hearts, Come let us join our friends above that have obtained the prize, And on the eagle wings of love to joy celestial rise: Connecticut - Carolyn Merrill. New Jersey - William Downin. California - Sandy Bayba, Niles Merton, John Lashley, Chris Reader, and J.R Kiehl. Susan Turpin then led [312t] and [163b] for the deceased, and song on page [340] for the sick and shut-in: California - Catherine Calahan of Santa Barbara, Karen Huss and Margaret Clark of Los Angeles; Ohio - John Bayer, Sr. Singing was resumed by Stephen O’Leary leading song on page [212]; Carla Smith [375], [376].

Jesse Roberts introduced the memorial lesson by making the following remarks: In the laste 1700’s, some of the American composers began to use discord in some of their music as a means of emphasis. William Billings, believing that the pure sounds we love so greatly today were the only proper ways to write music, wrote a satirical song to the “Goddess of Discord”. In that song, every syllable was a discord. It seems that like is often the way of that song. There are wonderful chords in life, but it seems that life is mostly composed of discords. There is joy in family, friends, and fellowship among our Sacred Harp singers, but more often, like is overshadowed by trials, hardship, sickness, and separation. Early in our lives, we sing songs in the Old Harp because of our love for the songs. As we get older, we begin to associate certain songs with specific singers, and eventually we associate most songs with beloved singers who have left us. When we sing these songs, it seems that we can still hear those singers who have gone to be with God still singing in our midst. Every singing and every song becomes a memorial to those singers, and not only to the singers, but to the God who loved and sustained them, and showed mercy to us in allowing these gracious people to influence our lives. Some we remember today have gone to be with the Lord; others are sick, and cannot be with us today. While we sing for those singers who have passed away this past year and those who are sick and feeble, and while we weep, this weeping and singing is for our loss, not theirs. They sing where there is no trial, or death, or sickness, or parting. God has given us the joy of singing in a time of mourning to confort our hearts and secure our understanding in the fact that ...“He arose, ascended high, and showed our feet the way; Up to the Lord our souls shall fly, At the great rising day.”Mike Hinton read the names from Alabama and led song on page [235] for the following deceased: Joe Beasley, Joe Smith, Dewey Williams, Aver Crider, Kelsey Wootten, Hoyt Renfroe, Effie Brock, Colbie Allen, Agnes Hocutt, Jack Harcrow, Pa Glover, Anita Wyatt, Ina Rosser, Tan Kelly, Hubert Green, Jessie Swindle, Ester Reed, Lois Roberson, and Robert McCowan.Tom Owen led song on page [101t] in memory of these singers from other states: New York - Robert Mattingdorfor; New Jersey - Roberta Adams; Texas - Lonnie Cato; North Carolina - J.

Shelbie Sheppard opened the Memorial Lesson with the following words: “It is just a joy, a great joy, that this many people can get together, from all walks of life, all occupations and nationalities, and sing to the glory of God. We may not all have the same religious creed, but whether we believe it or not, we all have one God. This list of names is long. You may not know anyone on this list, you may know them all. But somewhere in this walk of life, if you have not lost a loved one who appears on this list, that doesn’t mean you can’t sing for them, just like you sing for everybody else. Believe you me, I have been there, I know what I’m talking about. Sacred Harp friends mean more to you when you lose a loved one than you will ever know. Sacred Harp friends you can depend on. Sacred Harp friends are there when you need them, they’re there to help you, and when you lose one of them, it’s just like losing a member of your family. To show you what good friends I’ve accumulated over the years through Sacred Harp singing, I had people the first weekend in April that came to help me cook from the states of Washington, Minnesota, California, Illinois-and it goes on and on. And I would not have known any of them ten years ago, if it had not been for Sacred Harp singing. So if you don’t know anyone on this list, or if you know them all, sing as if it were a member of your family, because they were.” Steven Levine then read the names of the deceased: Alabama - Colbie Allen, Ester Reed, Agnes Hocutt, Joe Smith, Jack Harcrow, Aver Crider, Kelsey Wootten, Cleve Blevins, Hoyt Renfroe, Guy Parker, Dula Webb, Ruby Gibson, Hubert Greene, Dewey Williams, Tom Roberson, Homer Cordes, Ola Pruett, Lonnie Jones, Odell Cleveland, Elbert Drake, Russell Norton, Harold Jackson, Lawrence Daugherty, Luther Miller, Irvin Creel, Flecie Tucker, and Lucile Brothers; Arkansas - Odes Franklin; Georgia - Evelyn Browne, LeRoy McGraw, and Earline McGraw Baker; Illinois - George Edel, Lee Cloud, Jim Pizzia, and Doris Taub; Indiana - Welma Nelson, Walter Bavers, and Oscar Berlin; Michigan - Edith Hicks and Petra Coronado; Minnesota - Bruce Johnson; Mississippi - Cynthia Ledlow, Toxey Fortinberry, and George Boswell; New York - Joe Beasley and Bob Mottingdorfer; Pennsylvania - Ruth Fansler and Kenneth Goldstein; Texas - Lonnie Cato, Gerald Fry, Arnevis Norton, and Henrietta Henderson; Virginia - Matthew Shuster; Wisconsin - John Snowberg; Canada - Barbara Ward.

We thank strong hands who helped with setting up and tearing down for the sessions each day; we thank the hosts who housed, escorted, and transported visitors; we thank the Irish American Heritage Center and St. Paul’s Church. We thank the cooks-including people like Jan Ketelle, who, coming from Wisconsin, never fails to bring several dishes. And in that category, we also thank Kate Thomas, who with her helpers organized the spreading of the tables each day, and all the folks who helped in the kitchen, especially last night-a lot of out-of-towners helped with that. I’ve also been asked to thank people who traveled many miles to come and cook this weekend, including Carolyn Deacy, Katie Hicks, and Julie Vea. We thank all of our families and friends who may not be singers but who have understood our need to remove ourselves from the world and meet with our Sacred Harp family. We thank the treasured families who have cherished and sustained the precious tradition of the Sacred Harp for generations and traveled far to teach us and support all of us. We thank the Creator, within whose circling power we stand and whose praise we sing, and we resolve to continue the tradition and spread the joy of Sacred Harp here and in all the places we call home, and we resolve to return to Chicago and to faithfully support all the singings available to us throughout the year.” The closing prayer was then offered by Wendy Wahn, and “The Parting Hand” was led by the officers: Kathleen Kuiper, David Barford, D.

Devotional by Mary Craig: “Eye hath not seen; Ear hath not hear”; the glories that await us there. We commemorate today certain saints who have shared our faith walk, and now enjoy these glories, their faith having become sight. One beloved hymn reminds: “One day the silver cord will break, and I no more on earth shall roam...”. The chorus says: “And I shall see Him face to face, and tell the story ‘Saved By Grace’.” We are told in the scriptures that, while we are made a little lower than the Angels, we who have been saved by the blood of Jesus, will sing a new song, one that the Angels cannot sing. “I have been redeemed,” yes redemption’s song! Nature offers a good analogy to our departure: The Redwood tree, so strong, so majestic, lives a long time. When a tree dies, the cause of death is often catastrophic. Great trauma occurs when the tree falls to earth. The trauma, the impact, causes her to release her energies into the soil and surrounding atmosphere. Additionally, she releases burls that contain her means of continuity--her seeds. (You can buy these burls in gift or souvenir shops in the great Northwest. Some, coated with shellac, can be used as decorative items. Natural ones placed in a little moisture will grow, for you, a little redwood tree. How exciting to watch it emerge.) The mother tree never really dies, for she lives on in them. We, in dying, lose all our energies. Our bodies will decay. Our spirits will return to the One who gave them. But, just as the redwood provides for a circle of sister trees, we leave a circle of influence. We need to inquire of ourselves as to the quality of this influence. A song, page 208, “Little Songs and Little Ways” by Minnie Floyd, provides by closing prayer: “O give us Lord a little drop of heavenly love and union, O may we never, never stop short of a full communion.” Joan Smith led song on page 61, and Cindy Franklin led page 29b in memory of those who passed away in the past year: Anna Lou Ballinger Wylie, Rusk County, Texas; Monroe Grant, Texarkana, Texas; Agnes Hocutt, Jasper, Alabama; Kevin Aplin, Southeast Alabama; Dewie Wilks, Southeast Alabama; Dewey Williams, Southeast Alabama; Tommy Creel, Jefferson County, Alabama; Uncle Irvin Creel, March 8, 1996, Jefferson County, Alabama; Lucille Brothers, buried in Michigan; Andrew Stiefel, Fyffe, Alabama; Floyd Stiefel, Fyffe, Alabama; Suzy Schwinkendorf, Ft.

A quote from Ulysses states, “I am a part of all that I have met.” But we can add that we are a part of many whom we have not met. I never knew my Reid great-grandparents, but I am a part of them through heritage. This singing each year is a memorial to them, James Harris Reid and Margaret Jane Yarborough Reid; and their children, Emory Reid, Annie Reid Creel, Mattie Reid Creel, and in honor of Mamie Reid Creel, age [95]. The three Reid sisters married three Creel men so the Reid family and the Creel family became inseparably entwined. The present day Creel family members are their decendants and relatives. Since the singing last year, three members of the Creel family have died. Irvin Creel---Great Uncle Irvin, a soft-spoken man, lived into his nineties. Dillie Creel Harris---Great Aunt Dillie, blessed with a sweet smile, lived into her eighties. Tommy Creel---my cousin, seemingly too young to die, only lived into his forties. He loved family and enjoyed coming to this place. We are sad that they are no longer with us in this earthly life, but we can keep them in the secret places of our hearts and remember them whenever we wish. Our consolation comes from the words in Ecclesiastes 12:7. “Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.” Lucy Heidorn led song on page [345t], and concluded with prayer. Heavenly Father, We thank you for allowing us to know and love Uncle Irvin, Aunt Dillie, and Tommy. Grant us peace as we honor their memories. And now let all the people say, “Amen”.

Readings from Job and Romans were used. “For I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last He will stand upon the earth; and after my skin has been thus destroyed, then from my flesh I shall see God.” “We do not live to ourselves and we do not die to ourselves. If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord: so then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord’s.”We come to this singing and to this memorial lesson each with our own faith, our own memories, and particular individuals we sing for. While we are not all of one faith, we are of one song. It is Sacred Harp music that brings us and binds us together.The memorial lesson is a time to remember....to bring to the front of our thought those who have died in the last year as well as those who are sick and shut-in. It seems particularly important as we come together for our Anniversary Singing. There are many who were with us during the birthing process and early years of this group who are with us no more. This memorial lesson is a time to grieve, a time to celebrate the lives of those who now rest from their labors, as well as a time to sing back to health and life those who are sick and shut-in. Sacred Harp singing is about life. The songs we sing are about life’s journey, the struggles, and the hope of a better land and place to come. We have been blessed by these songs and by the fellowship of singers wherever and whenever we gather to sing. We are an extended family that spans over space and time. It is therefore fitting that we set aside time to remember those who have briefly walked with us in life’s journey. Celebrations are not always happy or joyous. It takes courage to mourn, to grieve, and to share those feelings with others. In the coming together to sing, the tunes, texts, and the very vibrations touch our souls and make the grieving easier because we know we are not alone. We probably all have an image of what heaven or life after death will be. I would like to share mine with you. I picture heaven a place of great celebration, where I will once again meet those whom I have lost...and what a grand reunion it will be! They will have a form that is whole, that is healed, and there, with God, they will welcome me with open arms. And there, with all the saints, will be the great heavenly banquet. There will be singing...a wonderful Sacred Harp singing, and the pain of life will be no more. As the names of those who have died are read, our collective remembering creates a sacred moment that touches the past, and celebrates the lives of those for whom we sing.Those remembered in death include: Bruce Mosier - Indiana; Tom Harper - Alabama; Mike Warner - California; Evelyn Browne and Edna Wilson - Georgia; Don Johnson - Colorado. Wendy Wahn led song on page [206] in their memory.John Seaton read the list of sick and shut-in, and led song on page [103] for the following: David Fichter, Alice Kuiper, Tina Seastrom, and Caroline Kramer - Illinois; the Malloy triplets and Joseph Brooks - Missouri; Cleo Hawkins and Bernice Embry - Mississippi.

Thanks were given, and acknowledgements made. Announcements were made of future singings.The officers of the singing came forward and led song on page [62] for the closing song. The closing prayer was given by Herb Schroeder. After the closing prayer, David Lee of Hoboken, Georgia showed those that wished to participate how to sing a “drone”. A small group stood facing each other in the center singing a tune. All four parts were represented in this center group...then in concentric circles outside that group, the basses walked one direction, a circle of trebles walked the opposite direction, and finally tenors on the outside going the same direction as the basses. Each person is his circle hummed the note of their part, walking slowly around the center singers. The object is to blend the voices into one mellow sound while allowing the voices in the center to be heard. This proved to be a very interesting experience for all.Chairperson - Anne Heider; Vice Chairperson - Kelly Brest van Kemper; Secretary - Daryl Mayberry."	1997	1	62	0	6	1	7	69	0.101449275362319

Ruth Brown introduced the memorial lesson by making the following remarks: “Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands! Serve the Lord with gladness! Come before His presence with singing!” So wrote the psalmist in the 100th Psalm.Every hour somewhere in this land of ours joyful noises are being made: the first joyful cry of a newborn baby; the joyful scream of victory; joy in listening to music; the joyful sound of the song of a bird; the tinkle of a wind chime.The psalmist admonished us to come before His presence with singing. Many groups and individuals do just that: choral groups, soloists, choirs, Sacred Harp singers. Sacred Harp is uniquely different. Singers come from all walks of life, represent all religious faiths, and different nationalities. Somewhere almost every week Sacred Harp singers meet to sing for the pure joy of it. It’s a joyful noise made for the comfort and satisfaction of the singer. This loyal, loving group meets to sing, weep, pray, laugh, eat, and talk together. We help, respect, defend, and love each other. And, faithfully, we pause to remember together those who in the past year have vacated a chair in their singing group. We remember their ever ready smiles, friendly handclasps, shared jokes, innocent pranks, the times they sat beside us and sang their joyful noise.We remember all these things with gladness--gladness because we knew them--gladness mixed with sadness, because in some way, almost every person in this room has been touched by the lives of some of the deceased. We can remember something special about many of them.As we read the names of the deceased, hold these people close to your heart--they are probably listening to us today as we remember them.

Along with those who have put forth so much effort, we are grateful for each one who has come from close at hand or far away.We are thankful for this music that brings us together in bonds of love and for the poetry that speaks to us in many different ways.When, on Thursday, we sang, to the tune of “Fulfillment”, “God’s holy spirit down is pouring, And Christians joining heart and hand,” we were singing about the experience that draws us, time and again, to sing together--truly with one accord. In the hope of singing with you all again at the 1998 National Convention, Liz Bryant and Ginnie Ely, Resolutions Committee.The Secretary reported that 460 people from 22 states and England registered during the three days of the Conventon, and that 190 leaders led 242 songs.State distribution of registrants is as follows: Alabama [303]; Georgia [44]; England 14; Massachusetts 14; Florida 13; Mississippi 12; Illinois 10; North Carolina 7; Kentucky 6; Texas 6; Tennessee 5; New York 4; Colorado 3; Louisiana 3; Rhode Island 3; California 2; Nebraska 2; Washington 2; Pennsylvania 2; Virginia 1; Missouri 1; South Carolina 1; Connecticut 1.

I was trying to get his attention, and I waved to him, when I realized that couldn’t be Jim. There was no way it could be Jim because Jim was 12 years gone.I just looked at the list of names for our memorial lesson today, and ladies and gentlemen, this list is long. You and I both know that there are names that are not on that list, names from other singings and names that are inscribed on our hearts, not on a piece of paper. We sing to remember them, and, I think, we also sing to unburden ourselves of all the things we meant to do for those we loved: the kind words left unsaid, the confidence left unshared, the feud left unnecessarily unmended. We sing hoping, and, I think, knowing, that through the power of our song and our prayers, we are reaching those we lost. And maybe we look around ourselves today and ask ‘What can I do right now, today?’ and maybe look inside ourselves and know that some time our day, some time my day, will come; that this community of singers, this band we belong to, will call out our names, and raise their voices in song. So now, let’s remember the bright souls of those we’re about to name, and those other names engraved on our hearts”.Suzanne Flandreau said: “I am reminded that we are enjoined to praise God in all things, so let’s praise God for these people - and the list is very long:”Deceased: Alabama - Rodger Morrison, Lola Myrtle Roberson, Jimmy Causey, Bonnie Ashley, Emma Nelson, Kenneth Brandon, Buck Aaron, Tommy Creel, Curtis Dutton, Johnnie Sue Beasley, Tilda Mosley, John Bain, Mae Doss, Ruthie Cozart, Floyd Stiefel, Otis Nall, Ed Latham, Clydus Moon, Dillie Creel Harris, Malone Austin, Elder A.L.

In memory of the deceased, Suzanne Flandreau led the song on page [285t].Richard DeLong then spoke: “I hope I can say something that will mean something to you. There are a couple of people on that list very near and dear to me, and it was awfully hard to sing for them, and not with them.You know, I’ve spent 8 years of my life trying to teach kids fun and unique things about history. I’ve also taught them some ugly things, some nasty things, about how we made war on each other, killed each other, enslaved each other, based on race, gender, beliefs and religion. And to me, Sacred Harp, the most precious thing about it, is that we can all come together, right here in this hollow square, and put that aside. We can shut that out. We can bar the door. We’ve developed a love for it, and every one of us has a personal testimony about this hollow square and what it means to you, what it means to me - what it means to me is not the same thing it means to you. These people we’re singing for had a testimony, but they can’t tell it.Hazel Cagle had a testimony. She was a Primitive Baptist; some of these Primitive Baptists can be hard-headed. She’d come up here, sing, and put anything else aside. She loved to sing. Kim just looked after her for 44 years, carried her to singing and carried her to singing. They came up here I don’t know how many times; when I asked him, he said he didn’t know. But she went to singings till she was hardly able to go, because that’s what she wanted to do. Kimzy’s been faithful; he’s looked after her 44 years, faithful, and he’s hurting.And these other people are hurting - I counted 18 names on that list that I’ve sung with, personally, 18 names. Kimzy asked me to sing [543]; we’ll try to do that.”After leading the song on page [543], he continued: “I would say that, as in a song we sang earlier, ‘let our songs abound, and every tear be dried.’ I would say at this convention, or any Sacred Harp gathering, let our songs abound. If you haven’t figured out how to come together, and love one another, and get along in the world, you don’t have to answer to me; you’ve got a much higher power to answer to.”Mary Rose O’Leary then read the list of sick and shut-in: Alabama - Jerry Sheppard, Mozelle Sheppard, Virgil Phillips, Ruby Phillips, Hadyn Creel, and Jap Walton; California - Dario Landazuri and Chris Thorman; Georgia - Mary Frances Dannals; Illinois - Josephine Mead, Hal Blumenthal, Pamela Veerhusen, John DeNys, Catherine DeNys, Marge Pesavento, and Frances Giunchedi; Indiana - Charlotte Allison; Maryland - Jack Hinchey; Michigan - Viola Smith; Minnesota - Sue Majerus; Mississippi - Cleo Hawkins and Bernice Embry; Virginia - Sally Barnes and Robert Toone.Mary Rose said: “I’d also like to remember people who aren’t able to come for whatever reason, and I hope that with this song we can sing them back to us.” She led song on page [168].The Memorial Committee then turned the class over to the Chairman who announced there would be one more singer before lunch.

We thank the Irish American Heritage Center and the University of Chicago Folklore Society for providing the wonderful facilities. We are thankful for all the food and for those who brought it. We thank Kate Thomas and Alan Thomas for organizing dinner on the grounds and the dinner for the social, recognizing all the work that this involves. Thanks to all the singers who came from near and far. Thanks especially to Ruth Brown for organizing the bus tour from Alabama and Georgia. Thanks for the excellent work of the Chicago Sacred Harp Singers and friends who planned and organized this convention. Finally, we are thankful for the Source of our existence, which makes all things possible. Be it further resolved that we each return next year.”Announcements were made of many upcoming singings across the country. The closing prayer was offered by Herb Schroeder, and “The Parting Hand” was led by the officers.Chairman - David Barford; Vice Chairman - D. J.

We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and be present with the Lord.”Linda continued with the following comments. “When God breathed the breath of life into man, he became a living soul. Death cannot touch that inner man. Death will touch the house we live in, but only until the resurrection when we will have a new body. We live in an ever changing world.

Most of all, we thank God who sent his showers of blessings down upon us this weekend.We resolve to meet again for next year’s convention, to fill this chapel with song and to remember these who have given so freely of their hearts and voices. May we give at least a small measure of what they gave to us throughout the years.”Respectfully submitted: D. J.

For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised: He also is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the people are idols: but the Lord made the heavens. Glory and honour are in His presence; strength and gladness are in His place. Give unto the Lord, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord glory and strength. Give unto the Lord the glory due unto His name: bring an offering, and come before Him: worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. Fear before Him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The Lord reigneth. Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein. Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the Lord, because He cometh to judge the earth. O give thanks unto the Lord; for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever”. B.E.

There is a scene in the movie where the King is presenting his wives to Anna. One of the wives, eager to show off her missionary English, stands, clasps her hands, and sings ‘There is a Happy Land....’ In almost every Ken Burns documentary we hear ‘Beach Spring’ as incidental music. Sacred Harp is a large part of the American musical tradition. Sacred Harp is alive. Let me consolidate that into one sentence: Sacred Harp is a living tradition. The definitions of living include growing and changing. As we look around, we see signs of growth. There are singers here from the West Coast, the East Coast, the South Coast, and all the coasts in between. I have been privileged to sing with, and call friend, singers from Canada and England. Sacred Harp has indeed grown, from a mostly Southern, rural, closely held activity, to a joyously vibrant movement, which, if we are careful to nurture it, will soon be worldwide in its scope. The other definition I mentioned is change. And Sacred Harp is changing. One of the signs of that change, and the direction of that change, is the presence here of so many living composers who write in the idiom. The music they write is rooted in the tradition, of course, but it is also firmly in the present. And the beauty of it is, as we sing their songs, they become traditional, and that process points to growth. And that growth is what we must resolve to be committed to. It is one thing to sing and be satisfied. It is quite another thing to want to see the singing grow, and that is the resolution I offer--to very loosely paraphrase Napoleon: We must sing and grow, sing and grow, always sing and grow!”Committee reports were all accepted as presented to the Convention.The Garden State Sacred Harp Singers then presented George and Jean Seiler, who have moved to New York State, with a plaque, signed by all the singers, thanking them for founding the Convention and local singings. The business session was then closed.Singing resumed with Peter Irvine leading song on page [86].

Johnny decided to use his free ticket and come to Los Angeles.Steven O’Leary gave the memorial lesson. He noted that the memorial lesson is less remote to him as he gets older and is pricked by loss. It didn’t mean so much when he was younger and couldn’t imagine dying. In Los Angeles, singers have sung with us and passed on. Also, those dear to singers have passed on. In a graveyard, gravestones try to make a permanent marking. Singing seems to be the antithesis of permanence; what’s more impermanent than a sound on the air? But, coming into the hollow square, we make a memorial more permanent and lasting than anything we carve in stone. Everything passes away. Nothing’s permanent The praise we sing is as permanent as anything in this world. As he read the names, he asked the class to remember that each person was precious to someone here. Those deceased: California - Leon Wilson, Mary Lou Jolley, and Peter Rydell. We sang [512] for the deceased.In remembering the sick and shut-in, we find God in each other.

Leaders: Midge Olsen [198]; Sarah Davie [503]; Steve Schmidgall [319].Judy Hauff began the memorial lesson. “In 1988 David Ivey attended his second Midwest Convention; he’s been here many times since. He was asked to serve on the Memorial Committee at that time, and he did so, with distinction. He chose to single out during that Memorial, a man named D. T. White, whom many of you knew, although, many in this room did not. When Ted Mercer and I made our first wild rush down South in 1985, he was one of the first people we met, and David mentioned exactly that fact in his Memorial. He said, ‘He didn’t wait for people to come to him, he came to them,’ and that was exactly the experience we had. We jumped off the plane in Atlanta, raced over to Holly Springs, stood around blinking at the sights that greeted us, and here through the crowd comes D. T. White, who promptly took charge of us, steered us straight over to his car, popped the trunk, and began loading us up with cookies, ‘Bama fans, whistle-shaped lollipops, and I don’t know what else, keeping up that characteristic line of patter of his that had everyone giggling all day. So of course we were delighted with D. T. White, and thought the world of him, but within just a couple of years he was snatched away. We’d been having such a good time, we didn’t even think in those terms. But suddenly he was gone, and it was a bad jolt for us. He was the first of the jolts, but not the last.”Judy continued, “The longer we sing this music, the more likely we are to know the names on the list. Richard DeLong has said he can look around the square, and see faces that he no longer sees, and hear voices he no longer hears. I can look around myself, at Jeff Sheppard, and think of Ruby Gibson, or look at Pauline Childers, and think of many people, maybe Mamie Creel, now; or at Shelbie Sheppard and Pam Nunn, and think of Lessie Cates; at Reba Dell Windom, and think of Willa Mae Holt, Margie Lacy, Noah Lacy, and Leonard Lacy; at Ted Johnson, and think of his brother, Don Johnson, at Connie Karduck, and think of her mother--people I knew, and miss.”“Up here we are 20, {30}, [40], {50}-somethings, but down South it’s more like [60], {70}, or {80}-somethings, and this is why the Memorial Lesson was actually made a part of the singing, because everyone would lead their tune as a memorial for someone they loved.”“I’ve had this persistent idea for really a long time that I am a visitor, a learner, a student; I’m a beginner, I’m a borrower in this tradition, an idea that I’ve held onto, but it doesn’t work in the face of the way other people let me know what they think my role is. When I’m made to feel like family, can I just step in, and step back out of this? I guess not; as far as Sacred Harp is concerned, you are what you are--or maybe you are what you sing, not to mention what you eat.”Asking David Ivey to lead for those from the South, Judy then read the list of the deceased as follows: Roberta Friend, Ingeborg Hoover, Natale Ambrogi, Frieda Storment, Lisa Schlaggar, and George Barford - Illinois; Leland Beckus and Kevin Blood - New Mexico; Willa Mae Holt, Venie Faith, and Anne Black - Georgia; Kim Cagle, Estelle Napier, Hollis Sizemore, Hadyn Creel, Mamie Creel, and Seldon Creel - Alabama; Ray Davis - Mississippi; Opan Johnson, Ruth Reid, and Audre Johnston Floyd - Florida; Rita Gorman - Pennyslvania; Joan Hamre - Iowa; Jean Ritter and Usha Helweg - Michigan; Dottie Horn, Leon Wilson, and Pete Rydell - California; William Whitelaw, Karen Wlard, and Carol Kirchner - Minnesota; Grace Vandenburg and Roberta Opedahl - Wisconsin; Louie Smith - Texas; Jane Thomas - England.David Ivey prefaced his lesson with the following: “We lead for singers, we lead for listeners, we lead to remember our relatives and friends. Mr. Hollis Sizemore was a listener who was just at our singing at Huntsville early in May; some of these, Kim and Hazel Cagle have made the trip up here several times. What Judy said about feeling like coming into the tradition struck me, because one thing I’ve been most thankful for in the singing as it has spread North, and as you folks have become Sacred Harp singers yourselves, you have embraced the tradition of Sacred Harp as it has been maintained through the many years. You could have had your own singings, done things different ways, chosen not to have Memorial Lessons, chosen not to do things in the way the tradition has been, but you didn’t.”“And I think because of that over the years, that you are traditional singers, and we really appreciate your support when you come to sing with us. We appreciate your remembering people in the Memorial Lesson.” He then led [87] for the Southern deceased. Denise Kania, cradling her sleeping daughter, led [122] for all the others.The list of sick and shut-ins was then read: Essie Calvert, Ernie Jett, Virgil Phillips, Ruby Phillips, Lawrence Underwood, Lula Underwood, and Woodie Walker - Alabama; Verl Gurtz and Ethel Klein - Florida; Mary Frances Dannals, Horace DeLong, Gladys Harper, Lil Huener, Beth Huener, C. Huener, and Emma Kelly - Georgia; Danny Albrecht and Marie Davie - Minnesota; Richard Allison and Liz Jacobs - Indiana; Isabel Arnold - Massachusetts; Kelly Beard - Texas; Dorothy Conniff - Wisconsin; Delores Doss, Nurse Knighton, and Frances Giunchedi - Illinois; Bernice Embry, Cleo Hawkins, and Hugh Bill McGuire - Mississippi; Mel Kersey - Tennessee; Viola Smith - Michigan; Ursula Woodfield - New York.Jeannette DePoy led <427t> after these moving comments: “Some of you may know that my mother passed away about two months ago, and I was given the most beautiful gift before she died. I had the opportunity to say everything I ever wanted to say to her before she died. Nothing was left unsaid between us. I say this to remind you of the people whose names are on this list. You can have a wonderful gift too; you have the opportunity to say to all of those people on that list how much you love them. Don’t wait. Don’t wait, thinking that they’ll be at the next singing and you’ll get a chance to talk to them then. Say it now. Let them know, and their families and their friends know, how much you love them.”After her lesson, Judy Hauff added, “I left one name off the sick and shut-in list deliberately, because I got a call the other night that was another bad jolt. It was Joyce Walton. Many of you know Joyce and Jap Walton; they are as devoted to Sacred Harp as anybody could be, and have taught singing schools and travelled together for years; Jap himself was an Arranging Committeeman at this Convention at least twice. He suffered a stroke almost two years ago, and they have been unable to go almost anywhere. I would like to lead a song that Jap so often leads. I understand the hymn to this tune was written by his aunt. Please skip the notes and sing the first and third verses; repeat the third verse.” The class then sang [420], which concluded the Memorial Lesson.Martha Henderson led the class in song on page [445]. Chaplain Shelley Robbins led the class in prayer before lunch.LUNCHD. J. Hatfield brought the class back together leading song on page [97].

A special thanks to the Irish American Heritage Center, the University of Chicago Folklore Society, and especially to the U of C Sacred Harp singers, Kiri Miller and her crew, for helping to secure this marvelous space; to the Locating Committee and to all of the other committees. You don’t know what it’s like to put on a show this big, but just get yourself on one of these committees and find out how much work it really is. It’s a joy, but it’s also great labor, and everybody needs to serve”.“Many thanks to all of the cooks who brought the amazing food, with a special heartfelt thank you to Kate Thomas and Nora Storment, who did all the food set-out, drinks, and clean-up; to Sue Kessell for arranging the splendid social on Saturday night; to all the other committee members and officers, you all have turned this into a must-not-miss event for any Sacred Harp singer in the country. To everyone else who helped with set-up and clean-up, all this chair-moving, you guys are terrific. Many thanks to the Chairman, D.J. Hatfield, and especially to all you singers, those of you who came from everywhere, from all over the country, and to all of you locals who housed us, fed us, carried us back and forth, our hearts are full; and especially to God our Father, who gave us voices to lift in His praise”.Announcements were made of upcoming singings across the country. After taking “The Parting Hand”, the class was dismissed with prayer by Chaplain Shelley Robbins.Chairman - D.J.

Mike Hinton made the following remarks: My aunt Ruth Denson Edwards died about 20 years ago. She had certain stories and expressions, and always ended with “...Don’t you know?” We knew and loved Aunt Ruth, her phrases, and her music. Many of the people whose memory we honor today had certain phrases, certain words, and yes, certain Sacred Harp tunes that they loved, and when we hear “their special song, their sugar stick”, we think of then. We honor Sacred Harp Singers, those singers sat in the class and led songs. Some cooked food and fed our bodies. Some of the singers we honor today sat in the congregation and never sang, but they knew every syllable and word of every song sung.The term “Sacred Harp Singer” is an inclusive term. And what did these singers sing about, what did they believe as they laughed, loved and hugged us? They sang of failing bodies, of being weary of lingering here, of never giving up the shield. They sang of the rose of Sharon, and being homeward bound, of seeking a long sought home, and bidding us adieu. They sang of meeting in heaven to sing praises of our Lord and King. They sang of never parting again, of shouting and singing hosanna, for heaven’s my home. As we hear the names of the deceased who have left us in the past year, remember their lives, their songs, and honor their memories, and visualize them around that great heavenly hollow square--don’t you know!Linda Thomas read the list of deceased: Alabama - Mae Seymour, Kim Cagle, Keterina Sanders, Bob Sanders, Bob Fannin, Charlie McCoy, Hadyn Creel, Mamie Creel, Gene Phillips, Lillie Phillips Hartley, Ozetta Gilliland, Vernice Calvert, Eugene Blackwood, Estelle Napier, Unie B.

As things come and go, these singers saw to it that the legacy of Sacred Harp singing remained permanent. They did this in countless ways: by serving on committees, preparing and serving food, donating money, and traveling to singings to help keep this music alive. An example of one such person was Kimsey Cagle who served as chairman of this singing for over 40 years and who we are remembering today. It’s very difficult for new singers coming into a singing or convention to feel a part of this singing family where parents and grandparents have been a part of the singings for years.

Garden State Convention	Upper Montclair, New Jersey	May 14-15, 1999	"Friday, May 14The seventh annual session of the Garden State Sacred Harp Singing Convention was held at the Montclair Friends Meeting House.The class was called to order at 7:30 p.m. by Gina Balestracci, who welcomed everyone and led song on page [59]. Marlin Beasley led the class in prayer.The convention then went into a business session. Of special note during this session was the formal announcement and signing of documentation for the incorporation of the Garden State Sacred Harp Singers. This was the culmination of many months of work by Roland Hutchinson.The following officers and committees were elected and appointed: Chairman - Gina Balestracci; Vice Chairman - Susan Bingham; Treasurer - Jean Seiler; Secretary - Rosemary Greenaway; Chaplains - Marlin Beasley, Mark Davis, George Seiler, and Cora Sweatt; Memorial Committee - Gina Balestracci and Rosemary Greenaway; Arranging Committee - Paula McGray and Laura Densmore; Keying - Mark Davis, Ginny Landgraf, Bob Parr, and Jean Seiler; Resolutions - Donna Abrahams; Reception - Susan Bingham and Marlene Levine; Food - Diane Mennella, Ellie Soler, Irene Carr, and Seth Holloway; Housing - Susan Bingham; Publicity - Roland Hutchinson and Ada Bruner of the Neward Star Ledger. The business session was closed.The class resumed singing with Rosemary Greenaway leading song on [29t].

Chairman Gina Balestracci introduced Mark Davis of Brandon, Mississippi, a respected singing school master and chairman of the Mississippi Convention.He opened his lesson speaking about the shape-note tradition in northern Mississippi. There they sing from the Denson Book, Cooper Book, and Christian Harmony, and they sing seven syllables (do, re, mi...) to the four shapes. He gave a demonstration of how this would sound and invited anyone to sing the songs in this fashion. He then referred the class to his lesson sheets. Among his handouts was an exercise in the Rudiments of Music suited to give a novice a quick understanding of the scale, intervals and rhythm. We sang [42] “in 4” followed by beating “in 2.” The use of the two systems of beating time illustrated clearly how a change in rhythm and accent can change the character of a song. The class then sang [87] as an example of 2/4 time. [56b] exemplified 3/4 time. [57] was sung as an example of compound time. The class sang several songs from the Eclectic Harmony: “Palmetto” (originally from the Christian Harmony and also Cooper Book [54]), “Will You Meet Me?” (Cooper 559). Mark Davis spoke movingly of the Sacred Harp tradition of singing songs that have special meaning for family and relatives thereby keeping the emotional and spiritual connection through the generations. We sang such a song, “Eden”, adding verses one and five from “Amazing Grace”. Mr. Davis concluded his class by speaking about the use of the drone in Mississippi. This practice usually closes their singings. While the square remains seated, the leader calls forth three or four singers to sing the tune. The class drones on the final pitch of their phrase while the “leaders” repeat the phrase two or three times, continuing on until the song is finished, almost in a call and response method. The class used “The Traveller” (The Social Harp) as a drone. Mark Davis concluded his lesson with prayer.The evening session ended with Gina Balestracci leading song on [510]. George Seiler offered the closing prayer.Saturday, May 15On Saturday morning the class reassembled, and the session was called to order by Gina Balestracci leading song on [77b]. Cora Sweatt offered the opening prayer.Chairman Gina Balestracci brought to the class’s attention a message sent by two singers who were unexpectedly absent from Friday’s opening session. Barbara Swetman and Allen Fannin sent word of a car accident the day before that prevented their attendance. In their absence they requested that we sing [475] for them.Leaders: Ginny Landgraf [218]; Brenda Peña [178]; David Boyle [159]; Sally Findley [155]; Nancy Thomas [84]; Karen Snowberg [49b]; Louis Naylor and George Seiler [347]; Janet Shipman <199>; Jim Wantland [479]; Tom Gibney [157]; Martin DeNys [232]; Gary Smith {569}; Mirjana Lausevic [70b]; Duncan Vinson [213T//213t]; Betty Hanf [481]; Walter Hartley [480]; Gerry Hoffman [272]; Dan Hertzler [362]; Martha Lang [48t]; Lisa Davis [528]; Katharine Hough [408]; Seth Holloway [388]; Cora Sweatt [312b].RECESSThe class resumed singing with Rosemary Greenaway leading song on [47t].

He asked that as he led song on page [159], we each think of any person or people who gave us music.

As I circulated throughout the existing Sacred Harp territory, I came to know most of those names. Now, again, when I go to singings there are many names on the list that I don’t know, and that is less a testimony of how little I get out anymore than how much our territories have expanded. In that we rejoice and take great heart.Two of the names that come to me are Don and Marilou Jolly from San Diego. I met them here at the Midwest Convention some years ago and instantly fell in love with them, as we often do with people in such sessions. They came south and sang with us. In April of 1997, I got a short letter from Marilou saying that we’re coming to the National Convention and we’re getting in on Wednesday night. “What can we do to help you?” That was entirely typical of them. They closed the note saying that they were so happy. Almost immediately she contracted a very aggressive form of cancer and died in early June. We greatly miss them! It was Marilou who was the singer of the two. Don came along with her, he participated, but Marilou was the one who took great joy in it. But Don, in her absence, became a real singer. When I was out in Los Angeles for the All-California Convention in January, he drove from San Diego to Los Angeles to participate; and now suddenly we find that Don has died. Very much like Marilou, he contracted a very fast form of cancer and died. That reminds me of a little bit about the human condition that we acknowledge and observe when we have the memorial lesson. These are the things that are expected of us, even anticipated, and so much surprise us both in terms of gain and loss. It catches us unaware.Of the names that have been read here, you will recognize many of these people. I think in particular of good old soldier stalwarts in the Sacred Harp cause: Mae Seymour, Jerry Sheppard, and Horace DeLong. Horace DeLong was 92 years of age, and what a lovely man he was!I’m going to sing the song on page [390], New Prospect, and would like to bring your attention to this song, written by W.S. Turner, an itinerant Methodist preacher. His father, J.R. Turner, gave us Confidence ([270]) and Monroe ([370]). But look at the date (on New Prospect) - 1866. Think of what loss they suffered in their time and out of that he gave us this beautiful song. I commented on this some years ago in a memorial lesson at another convention. As we sing in their memory here today, our hope is that it will be sung with the same meaning as over a hundred years ago, and with the peace that is depicted in the last verse of this song”.Melanie Hauff led the song on page [368] for the others on the list of the deceased.Wendy Wahn read the list of sick and shut-ins: Marie Ivey, Virgil Phillips, Ruby Phillips, Woodie Walker, Jap Walton, and Joyce Walton - Alabama; Sara Curry - California; Dorothy Garber and Susan Garber - Connecticut; Gerrie DeLong, Mozelle Sheppard, and Allene Stanford - Georgia; Janet Fraembs, Marilyn Nehring, Bob Hillis, Josephine Mead, Pam Eckley, and Bill Hackney - Illinois; David Sours and Jay Featherstone - Michigan; Bernice Embry and Hugh Bill McGuire - Mississippi; Marie Davie and Helen Stevens - Minnesota; Joanne Mahler and Cindy Shely - Missouri; Scott Strong - New Jersey; Janet Burn - Pennsylvania; Hubert Anderson - Tennessee; William J. Reynolds - Texas.Shelbie Sheppard spoke and led song on page [327] for the sick and shut-ins. “Many of you have heard me say many times what a privilege it has been to sing with a lot of great people, a lot of people that are in this room, and we start naming names and we forget to mention some. But it is a privilege to sing with you. You are a great singer now and it’s our privilege to sing with you and we appreciate that. The list of the sick and shut-ins is long and it doesn’t even begin to cover everyone that is sick, and if you have ever been sick you know how much this means to you to think that somebody is thinking of you. Some of us have been that way, and there are those of us now that are sick, so it is a privilege to sing for those persons.”Jesse Roberts closed the memorial with prayer.Leaders: Joseph Pimentel [107]; Scott DePoy [282]; Christine Stevens [74b]; Martha Beverly [358]; Marian Mitchell [147t]; Donald Klein [466].

He found here not just Sacred Harp, but a tradition. Singers from the South come and meet singers from the North at this “gateway” convention; the tradition is extended and blessings are shared. Quoting from the front of the book, Keith said, “Resolved that this Convention always seek the old paths and walk therein.”The business session was closed.

Mike Hinton’s comments: “This is a time that sets Sacred Harp singings apart from other musical gatherings. These moments, when we pause to remember our friends and loved ones who left this life since we sang together here last year, are very special moments.The class that is gathered around that hollow square in the New Jerusalem is a little larger this year. Tired, frail bodies have been made whole, memories restored, sight and hearing made new, voices are vibrant. We rejoice for having known these dear people: they were mothers and daddies, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. We honor them all.I would also like to say that “Sacred Harp Singer” is an all-inclusive term which includes those who sing in the class, those who sit in the congregation and listen, and those who prepare the food we enjoy, and others who love this music. I also like to think of the message these dear ones would have for us. I think they would tell us to be “flower singers.” My grandfather was asked by his friend Leon Odem to write the notes for verses Mr. Odem had discovered. The song is titled “Odem”, and it exhorts us to give roses to each other while we live. Don’t wait until we gather round a grave to say sweet things and present useless flowers. Life is the time for words of praise, the time to give flowers. Sacred Harp singers give each other flowers: in a hearty handshake, a hug, and words of encouragement.

We were requested to ask ourselves, why are we here as Sacred Harp singers? And, why are there other true Sacred Harp singers not here? Hold this thought in mind. We were reminded of two women singers who, if they were here in the body and the spirit, would be here today, in this place, and raise their voices. These were the mothers of Johnny and Delorese Lee, who died sixteen years ago. Johnny Lee’s mother is buried in front of a headstone reading, “Give me the roses while I live....” Was she seeking a handful of flowers? No. She was seeking, as another song says, the Rose of Sharon, that special rose. Those of us here today also want the Rose of Sharon. Let us try to remember the sick and shut-ins by visiting or writing them, telling them of attending the Minnesota singing, and sharing with them who were here, and which songs touched our bosom.Johnny Lee read the names of the sick and shut-ins, and led song on page [340]. He then called for Rodney Ivey to lead [376].The Memorial Lesson followed. Walter Graff reminded us that we are part of a wonderfully varied community of men and women of all sorts and conditions. Why do we remember those whom we have never met? Because we are part of a great river of community, and the dead are simply those who have left at an earlier upstream port, but who have left their legacy of this singing tradition to us, for which our gratitude is profound. A song from Missouri Harmony was quoted: “My lips shall teach it to my sons and daughters, that generations yet unborn may teach it yet to theirs.”Walter Graff read the names of the deceased, and called for Jim Pfau to lead [285t] in their memory.Walter then said that, despite disturbing images from popular media nowadays, we know from the Bible that we are assured in the after-life of three things: that we will enjoy God’s presence, that we will recognize each other, and that we will sing. Walter Graff gave the prayer to close the memorial lesson.The names of the deceased were: Flossie Jones, Vester Jones, Lindberg Lacy, Phillip James, and J.V.

University of Chicago Anniversary Singing	Friends’ Meeting House, Chicago, Illinois	October 30, 1999	"The second session of the University of Chicago Anniversary Singing was called to order at 11:30 a.m. by outgoing Chairman Mark Miller leading song on page [99]. After welcoming remarks were given, Jim Swanson led the class in prayer.Leaders: Kiri Miller [270]; Kate Lingley [59]; Jim Swanson “Sessions” (CB); Marcia Johnson [440]; Jim Page “South Dakota” (by Jim Page); Bill Beverly {52}.A short business meeting was conducted with the following officers elected or appointed to serve: Chair - Kiri Miller; Vice Chair - Kate Lingley; Secretary - Mark Miller; Chaplain - Jim Swanson; Arranging Committee - Mark Miller; Memorial Committee - Suzanne Flandreau and Jim Swanson; Resolutions Committee - Cathryn Baker; Finance Committee - Dean Slaton.Leaders: John Seaton [47t]; Berkley Moore “Lingham” (ACH); Cathryn Baker “Boulder” (by Ted Johnson); Dave Stockwell [63]; Doug Stapleton [66]; Pete Ellertsen “Devizes” (NHC).RECESSKate Lingley brought the class to order leading song on page [178]. Leaders: Suzanne Flandreau {274}; Rosemary Greenaway [171]; Martha Beverly “Palmetto” (CB); Dean Slaton [110]; Ann Meczulski {378}; Randy Neufeld [128].Jim Swanson began the memorial lesson noting the importance in the Jewish tradition of sanctifying a space to be used for an important purpose, and its similarity to the manner in which singers are careful always to take time out of a singing, when they’d be happy to sing straight through, to sanctify time with the memorial lesson. He then expanded and inverted this relation between time, considered in human terms, measured in lives and deaths, and sanctification of it through the cessation of singing, saying that in a larger sense (i.e. not within the temporal confines of a singing), singing is an effective way to sanctify time, and with that, the passing of loved ones. He went on to recount music’s relation to the final moments of several of his friends and family members’ lives, and remarked on the value of that relationship and on the binding force of music on those who celebrated the deaths. Lastly, he read the list and led song on page [159] for the deceased: Lawrence Steger, Ted Storlie, Gerry Armstrong, Gladys Johanan - Illinois; Cleo Hawkins - Mississippi; Ethel Klein - Florida.Suzanne Flandreau continued the lesson on behalf of the sick and shut in, emotionally recounting the wonderfulness and terribleness of her thirty years of singing, meeting singers, watching them pass away or into less active phases of their lives having gone from thinking the memorial lesson a somewhat mundane and not entirely welcome adjunct to the Sacred Harp tradition to considering it to be at the core. The extent to which she has been transformed was exemplified, she believed, by the fact that in her earlier years of singing she knew no one who was on the memorial lists, but at this day’s singing alone, she added five names herself, in addition to knowing a great many others. Sick and shut-ins: Linda Morris - Maryland; John Flandreau - New York; Bernice Embry, Hugh Bill McGuire, and Madeline Steel - Mississippi; Bob Scorgie and Nick Fabke - Wisconsin; John Bailey and Melanie Hauff - Illinois; Virgil Phillips and Ruby Philips - Alabama; Vivian Rogers - Georgia.The memorial was closed.Leaders: Jim Helke [186]; Susan Geil {81}; Bruce Holmes {147}; Sue Kessel [146]; Steve Warner [89]; Ted Johnson [84].LUNCHKiri Miller brought the class to order leading song on page [454].

And whereas we could not enjoy such company or carry on the tradition and love of this music without dedicated people, let us resolve to be thankful for all those who have helped this fledgling Hyde Park group come to existence and carry on for these past two years. We would like to make a special resolution for Suzanne Flandreau who has tirelessly listened to our ideas and helped to shape them even more surely than we sometime named our notes... The weekly singings have also benefited greatly from the presence of Doug Stapleton and Bruce Holmes...The undergrads, especially the first year students, should be thanked...They have shown great persistence in coming each week to the singings in the neighborhood and even getting us to sing songs we don’t know, because they don’t know what we have sung a hundred times...Let’s be resolute in thanking the Chicago Sacred Harp Singers for all their assistance to us, morally, emotionally, and in actual task assistance... Which brings us to thankfulness and appreciation for all those who brought food, and those who enjoyed it...There are people who do lots of work to pull these singings off. To that end, let’s resolve to thank all the officers and committees. You who have come from downstate Illinois, New Jersey, Michigan, Wisconsin and Ontario are part of what helps maintain the links of our fellowship, much as circuit preachers once did for the singing schools in earlier times. So we much appreciate the time you have taken to join us in song and fellowship and hope to join you in your singings. We are mindful that the music is primarily for the praise of God and joy in the creation and that we are only here a short while, so we need to be mindful of how we live...”The resolutions were approved for addition to the minutes of the singing by unanimous consent.Announcements were made.

This fellowship brings great joys. It helps us remember traditions that have been handed down for many years.

Many start singing older than she is, but we are all taught by those who are older still. It is difficult to see those who taught her appear on these lists, with more and more names being familiar as time passes. She reminded us that we could still help the people on this list and urged us to do so.

Eloise Clark spoke to the class about the traditions that make a Sacred Harp convention more than just the songs and music that we all love. These things, which include dinner and taking our turn in the square, give us pleasure, release, and relaxation. But, they also include traditions that help us to ground ourselves to our place in this world. They help us to recognize and accept our human frailties and as expressed in the memorial lesson, that our path from birth to death is inevitable.In this 21st century America, we are often in too big a rush to stop to realize that sickness and death are also part of our existence. When we rush through life we don’t take care to value that what we have is ours only for a short time before we pass it to the next generation. We do not take the time to listen to those who can teach our generation about what we can do to make our life better and about dying.The memorial lesson is our opportunity to slow down, take a deep breath and appreciate the aspects of being on earth - that we are born; we learn from our elders, we teach our children and grandchildren; then pass on. One way that we can express our appreciation for life and the lives of others is to think of those who cannot be with us today. Some are ill and may be otherwise shut in. Others have passed on. Let us now turn our thoughts and prayers to those sick and shut-ins: Ed Huener - Ohio; Eleanor Chamberlain - Pennsylvania; Harrison Creel, Flarce Creel, Marie Aldridge, and Sheila Moon - Alabama. Kay Huener led song on page [217] for those remembered.Now let us turn our attention to those friends and family who have passed to another home: Glenn Conrad - Ohio; Libby Dukes and Perry Arndt - Florida; Jean Farwell - Illinois; Scharlene Nesler - Oklahoma. Pauline Childers led song on page [288] for the deceased.
